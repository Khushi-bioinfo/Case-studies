🧪 Case Study 1: Cancer Genomics
A 52-year-old woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her tumor biopsy is sequenced, and multiple mutations are found in TP53, BRCA1, and a previously uncharacterized gene labeled “GENX1.” Your task is to analyze these mutations and determine their potential role in cancer development.

🧬 Case Study 2: Comparative Genomics
You’re given the genome sequences of zebrafish and humans. Your goal is to identify genes conserved between the two, and analyze whether these genes are involved in developmental processes.

🧫 Case Study 3: Microbial Genomics
A newly discovered bacterial strain shows resistance to multiple antibiotics. You’re tasked with finding the genes responsible for resistance and determining whether they were acquired through horizontal gene transfer.

🌍 Case Study 4: Evolution & Phylogenomics
You’re analyzing four plant species and notice that two of them share a large number of gene duplications. Your task is to determine whether this is due to a whole genome duplication event and estimate when it happened.

🧪 Case Study 5: Applied Genomics – Pharmacogenomics
A patient is prescribed a blood thinner but has an adverse reaction. Genetic testing reveals a variation in the CYP2C9 gene. How would you analyze this variation, and what implications does it have for treatment?
